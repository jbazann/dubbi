    <p>
        This section contains poems I write to improve my English. Warning: they may be really bad,
        they also may involve sensitive topics.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have split them into collections, but I just started writing a couple years ago,
        so I only have one collection until I feel like I know what I'm doing.
    </p>
    <p>
        Available collections:

    <ul class="inline-list">
        <li><em>early-drafts</em></li>.
    </ul>
